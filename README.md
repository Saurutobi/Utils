Common Utils I use across multiple machines

-Git Stuff
	common base .bashrc I use. Abstracts some shell functions and many git commands
	supporting files like .bash_profile, windiff.sh
	Requires:
		Git folder to be placed in "c/Program Files (x86)"
		kdiff3 installed
		notepad++ installed
		winmerge installed
	Setup:
		make sure folder is copied
		import winmerge settings into winmerge
		copy the files in Home to your shell's home directory(typically "c/Users/[YOUR USERNAME]/"
